1] Firebase SDK;
    1) To use Firebase on your app , install the SDK with this command : npm install firebase

2] How to set up FireBase on your App :
    1) Create a firebase.js file at {appname}\lib
        Next.js uses this dir for the firebase exports and imports. I also used it for the Login and Dashboard
    2) Export anything you need from Firebase.
        This allows the app to use whatever Firebase can provide be it auth , db etc . 
        Contact me (Reinhard) if I need to add anything to the Firebase
    3) Firebase Config.
        Use the firebaseconfig for your Apps aswell , this connects to the Firebase Web App I made .
        Dont change any of it , if you do you wont be able to connect to Firebase.

    3) Dashboard 
        After login , it takes you to the dashboard . Here , simple data will be shown from the Firestore Database 
        These data has the tag of users.note and users.title
    4) User specific Database
        Each user has their own "Collection" of data they can have , as of now it is a manual procedure to create their own database.
        The Firestore database structure looks like this : users - {userid} - {users.title} , {users.note}.
        The userID is generate by Firebase itself , it is unique to each user and used for authentication.
